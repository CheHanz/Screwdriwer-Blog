                    <p>The screwdriver, one of the most essential tools in human history, has origins that trace back to the Middle Ages. The earliest known screwdrivers appeared in Europe around the late 15th century, coinciding with the development of screws for armor and firearms.</p>
                    <p>Initially, screws were made by hand and were expensive to produce. The matching screwdrivers were flat-bladed and often custom-made for specific screws. The industrial revolution in the 18th century brought mass production to both screws and screwdrivers, making them widely available.</p>
                    <p>The modern flathead screwdriver was perfected in the early 19th century, while the Phillips head screwdriver (the cross-shaped one) was invented by Henry F. Phillips in the 1930s to allow better torque application and prevent over-tightening.</p>

            <h2>Evolution of Screwdriver Design</h2>
            <p>From simple wooden handles to ergonomic designs, screwdrivers have undergone significant transformations:</p>
            <ul class="evolution-list">
                <li><strong>1500s-1700s:</strong> Hand-forged iron with wooden handles</li>
                <li><strong>1800s:</strong> Mass-produced steel blades with improved wooden or bone handles</li>
                <li><strong>Early 1900s:</strong> Introduction of plastic and rubber handles</li>
                <li><strong>1930s:</strong> Invention of the Phillips head</li>
                <li><strong>1950s-present:</strong> Ergonomic designs, magnetic tips, and specialized bits</li>
